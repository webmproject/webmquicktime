 Building WebM component
=========================

This document will quickly guide you through how to build the WebM
QuickTime component. The instructions below should work in any fairly
up-to-date Mac environment, but specifically were tested in Mac OS X
10.6.8 with Xcode 3.2.6.


Build prerequisites
===================

 * Git
   - download and install Git (http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/)

 * Yasm (required to build libvpx)
   - download, build and install Yasm (http://yasm.tortall.net/)


Getting source code and dependencies
====================================

Get the component source code (issue from command line):

 > git clone http://git.chromium.org/webm/webmquicktime.git webmquicktime
 > cd webmquicktime

Pull the dependencies (from within the cloned repository):

 > git submodule update --init


Compiling
=========

From command line, just type:

 > make

Or, using Xcode UI open the WebM.xcodeproj and hit the build button.

If the compilation finished succesfully, the component bundle should
be ready under build/Release directory.


Testing
=======

Place the component bundle where QuickTime can find it. From the
top-level directory of the cloned repository type:

 > cp -pR build/Release/WebM.component ~/Library/QuickTime/

QuickTime Player 7 now should be able to open *.webm files and export
to WebM format. Give it a try.
